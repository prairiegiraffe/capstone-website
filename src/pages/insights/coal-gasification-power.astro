        <!-- Introduction -->
        <p class="text-xl text-slate-700 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-8">
          Coal gasification represents one of the most significant opportunities for industrial revitalization in coal-producing states. This comprehensive guide addresses the technical, economic, and strategic questions surrounding coal-to-products infrastructure.
        </p>

        <!-- Section A: Technical & Process Questions -->
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6 border-t-4 border-gold-500 pt-6">Section A: Technical & Process Questions</h2>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-8 mb-4">What is gasification, and how does it differ from combustion?</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Gasification is not burning coal. It is a controlled, oxygen-lean conversion process that breaks coal down at the molecular level into syngas — hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and other constituents.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Combustion destroys the fuel; gasification repurposes it into strategic molecules.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-8 mb-4">Why is this considered "blue" ammonia or "blue" hydrogen?</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          "Blue" refers to hydrogen and ammonia produced with permanent CO₂ management.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          In gasification, CO₂ is separated early and efficiently, making high-purity, low-carbon ammonia achievable. It is not a marketing label — it is a function of the underlying chemistry.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-8 mb-4">Why coal as a feedstock instead of natural gas or biomass?</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Three reasons:</p>
        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 text-lg text-slate-700 mb-6 ml-4">
          <li><strong>Energy density</strong> — coal provides a stable, high-energy feedstock for gasification.</li>
          <li><strong>Economic benefit</strong> — coal states retain value instead of importing alternative feedstocks.</li>
          <li><strong>Strategic stability</strong> — coal prices are less volatile than natural gas. This keeps project economics predictable over decades.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-8 mb-4">Where does the CO₂ go?</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The CO₂ stream is dehydrated, compressed, and transported to secure geologic storage. Both Class II (EOR) and Class VI (permanent storage) pathways are available. Wyoming and West Virginia both have favorable geology and regulatory frameworks.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-8 mb-4">Can West Virginia store its own CO₂?</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Yes. West Virginia has recognized saline formations and depleted reservoirs suitable for CO₂ storage. The state's existing geologic footprint is compatible with Class II and Class VI pathways.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-8 mb-4">How reliable is hydrogen-fired power generation?</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Hydrogen turbines are advancing rapidly, with commercial units delivering stable, dispatchable power. For industrial facilities like CC2A, hydrogen-fired generation enhances reliability and reduces grid dependence. H₂ produced and consumed onsite for power production. Transportation of hydrogen is a deal breaker with the current technology.
        </p>

        <!-- Section B: Economic & Workforce Questions -->
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6 border-t-4 border-gold-500 pt-6">Section B: Economic & Workforce Questions</h2>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-8 mb-4">How many jobs will a CC2A-type project create?</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">A facility of this scale typically generates:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-lg text-slate-700 mb-6 ml-4">
          <li>1,000–1,500 construction jobs, and</li>
          <li>100+ permanent high-skill positions across operations, maintenance, process engineering, and logistics.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-8 mb-4">Do existing coal workers qualify for these jobs?</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Absolutely. Gasification, ammonia synthesis, power generation, and CO₂ operations all rely on skill sets coal states already possess:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-lg text-slate-700 mb-4 ml-4">
          <li>Electricians, Mechanics, Instrumentation techs</li>
          <li>Heavy industrial operators</li>
          <li>Safety personnel, Process operators</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Retraining is measured in weeks and months, not years.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-8 mb-4">What is the anticipated economic impact?</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">A CC2A-scale project delivers:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-lg text-slate-700 mb-6 ml-4">
          <li>Hundreds of millions in annual economic activity</li>
          <li>Stable tax base from high-value manufacturing</li>
          <li>Long-term skilled employment</li>
          <li>Secondary industries tied to ammonia, hydrogen, and CO₂ management</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          This represents industrial revitalization, not just energy development.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-8 mb-4">A tough question: Doesn't this compete with natural gas?</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          No — it complements it. Coal-to-products reduces reliance on natural gas for ammonia production, while natural gas remains crucial in power generation, manufacturing, and petrochemicals.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Utilizing coal ammonia and power production in the US frees up natural gas to be converted into LNG and make the US the largest energy exporter in the world. Both markets grow and capitalize on increased demand.
        </p>

        <!-- Section C: Policy, Regulatory & Incentive Questions -->
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6 border-t-4 border-gold-500 pt-6">Section C: Policy, Regulatory & Incentive Questions</h2>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-8 mb-4">How do federal incentives apply?</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The project is eligible for:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-lg text-slate-700 mb-6 ml-4">
          <li>45Q tax credits (CO₂ capture and storage)</li>
          <li>DOE support for hydrogen/ammonia infrastructure</li>
          <li>FEMA/EDA/USDA infrastructure support in certain counties</li>
          <li>Potential DoD procurement for maritime fuel and ammonia</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          These incentives enhance bankability but are not the sole economic driver.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-8 mb-4">What permitting lessons has Wyoming learned?</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Three lessons translate directly to West Virginia:</p>
        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 text-lg text-slate-700 mb-6 ml-4">
          <li>Align early with the state's geological survey and regulatory agencies.</li>
          <li>Coordinate federal and state reviews to shorten timelines.</li>
          <li>Engage community and industry stakeholders early to reduce friction in siting.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-8 mb-4">What commitments would West Virginia need to make?</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Commitments are modest and state-controlled:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-lg text-slate-700 mb-6 ml-4">
          <li>Regulatory certainty around Class II/Class VI</li>
          <li>Support for siting and transmission planning</li>
          <li>Workforce development alignment</li>
          <li>Coordinated industrial permitting</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Not subsidies — clarity.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-8 mb-4">Does this align with West Virginia's hydrogen hub status?</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Yes. CC2A-type facilities directly support hydrogen hub objectives by producing hydrogen-rich ammonia and generating hydrogen for internal power.
        </p>

        <!-- Section D: Strategic Positioning Questions -->
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6 border-t-4 border-gold-500 pt-6">Section D: Strategic Positioning Questions</h2>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-8 mb-4">Why is ammonia strategically important right now?</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Because ammonia carries hydrogen safely, is globally traded, and is central to fertilizer, explosives, and emerging maritime fuels. It is increasingly viewed as a strategic national commodity.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-8 mb-4">How does this support industrial re-shoring?</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The U.S. currently imports a significant portion of its fertilizer and ammonia. Producing ammonia domestically reduces vulnerability to foreign supply shocks — especially from the Middle East and Russia.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-8 mb-4">What makes West Virginia especially relevant?</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Its proximity to Appalachian manufacturing, inland waterways, chemical industries, and eastern rail corridors makes it ideal for ammonia distribution and downstream manufacturing.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-8 mb-4">Is coal gasification really "clean"?</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          When paired with permanent CO₂ management, yes. "Clean" does not mean zero emissions — it means controlled emissions with geological storage.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          This is supported by physics, not rhetoric.
        </p>

        <!-- Section E: Political & Narrative Questions -->
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6 border-t-4 border-gold-500 pt-6">Section E: Political & Narrative Questions</h2>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-8 mb-4">Does coal-to-ammonia mean abandoning coal-fired power?</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Not at all. It creates a new industrial path for coal, independent of power markets. This diversifies coal demand and stabilizes coal communities.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-8 mb-4">How do we explain this to coal miners and community leaders?</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-navy-900 font-semibold leading-relaxed mb-6 bg-slate-50 p-6 border-l-4 border-gold-500">
          "This project does not replace coal mining — it repurposes coal to create new, long-term jobs and industrial demand. It is the next chapter, not the last."
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-8 mb-4">Will this hurt thermal coal markets?</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          No. This is an additive industry with distinct demand. Gasification uses coal as a feedstock, not a fuel, so it does not compete with power markets directly.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-8 mb-4">How is this different from 'clean coal' campaigns of the past?</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Two differences:</p>
        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 text-lg text-slate-700 mb-6 ml-4">
          <li>Gasification is a mature industrial technology, not a speculative retrofit.</li>
          <li>CO₂ management is integrated into the chemical pathway itself — not an afterthought.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          This is chemistry, not marketing.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-8 mb-4">What does cooperation between Wyoming and West Virginia look like?</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Data sharing, siting analysis, FEED-study cooperation, ammonia offtake coordination, and workforce training pipelines. Wyoming brings lessons learned; WV brings manufacturing proximity and workforce depth.
        </p>

        <!-- Section F: Hardball Questions from Skeptics -->
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-12 mb-6 border-t-4 border-gold-500 pt-6">Section F: Hardball Questions from Skeptics</h2>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-8 mb-4">Isn't gasification too expensive?</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Not when ammonia is the anchor product. Ammonia manufacturing margins support capital cost recovery, and federal incentives further strengthen economics.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-8 mb-4">Has this been done successfully in the U.S.?</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Yes — the U.S. has operated gasification and ammonia synthesis facilities for decades. The innovation here is integration, not invention.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-8 mb-4">Is CO₂ sequestration safe and permanent?</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Yes. Geological storage in saline formations and depleted reservoirs is well understood, highly regulated, and monitored with modern subsurface technologies.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-8 mb-4">What is the risk if federal incentives change?</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The project is designed to be economically viable—even without them—because ammonia and chemical manufacturing generate durable value streams. 45Q accelerates ROI; it does not define the project.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-8 mb-4">What if ammonia markets weaken?</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Ammonia markets have been stable for a century due to agriculture, explosives, energy, and chemical demand. Downstream diversification (urea, DEF, maritime fuel, hydrogen power) protects revenue.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-navy-900 mt-8 mb-4">Why should the state care — shouldn't the private sector handle this?</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Because siting, regulation, and infrastructure are inherently state functions. Role clarity from the state makes private investment possible.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          States don't finance these projects — they enable them.
