CapStone Sustainable Carbon Solutions advances coal-to-products manufacturing and carbon-managed industrial infrastructure.

CTA Button: Learn About the Project

Intro Section

CapStone is a project development and execution platform focused on transforming Wyoming's energy-dense resources into essential industrial products — starting with blue ammonia production and integrated carbon management.


We bridge early-stage concept development through Pre-FEED, capital alignment, and execution readiness for large-scale energy and industrial facilities.


Three Value Props (optional — can do icons or simple cards)
Coal-to-Products
Converting regional coal resources into high-value industrial outputs including ammonia and dispatchable power.
Carbon Management
Integrating carbon capture and geological storage into project design from day one.
Wyoming First
Anchored in Wyoming's regulatory primacy for CO₂ storage and existing industrial infrastructure.

PAGE 2: THE PROJECT
Hero/Header
Headline:

Wyoming Coal-to-Ammonia Initiative

Subhead:

Next-generation industrial manufacturing with full carbon integration.


Project Overview

CapStone's marquee initiative is a Coal-to-Ammonia project sited in Wyoming — a next-generation industrial facility converting regional coal resources into blue ammonia and dispatchable power generation, while integrating carbon capture and geological storage.


The project utilizes 21st-century gasification processes to produce low-carbon intensity ammonia at scale.


Why This Matters (can be 3 cards or simple list)
National Security
Domestic ammonia production reduces reliance on foreign supply chains for a critical industrial input.
Food Supply Chain
Approximately 80% of global ammonia production supports agricultural fertilizer. Stable domestic supply protects American food security.
Clean Energy Transition
Blue ammonia is emerging as a carbon-free fuel source. Demand is projected to grow significantly in the coming decade.

Project Status

The project is currently in structured Pre-FEED development, leveraging Wyoming's emerging CO₂ storage regulatory framework and existing industrial fertilizer infrastructure.

NOTES FOR BUILD

Clean, professional aesthetic — not flashy
Photography direction: Wyoming landscape, industrial/energy imagery (similar vibe to Glenrock site)
Colors: Suggest blues, grays, maybe a green accent — nothing trendy
Mobile responsive obviously
No blog needed
No fancy animations — these reviewers don't care
